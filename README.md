“This is my first personal portfolio website. It includes a home section with my name and bio, an about section with my skills and education, a projects section showcasing 2–3 projects, and a contact section with a form and social links. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages.”
